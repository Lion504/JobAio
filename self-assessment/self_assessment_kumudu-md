### 1. Functionality
- **Does the code meet the requirements?**
  - [X] Does it implement all specified features you were responsible for?  
  - [X] Are edge cases handled (e.g., invalid data, duplicates)?  
  - [ ] Are there any bugs or unexpected behaviors?  

- **Integration**
  - [X] Does your code work correctly with other parts of the application?

  - [ ] Is the code optimized for larger datasets or high traffic (if applicable)?  

---

### 4. Overall Assessment
- **Strengths**  
  - List the strengths of your contribution.  
  - Pure, side-effect-free function
  - Handles missing data and empty lists gracefully
  - Uses Set to avoid duplicates

- **Areas for Improvement**  
  - List areas where your code could be improved. 
  - Language variants
  - Convert into faster lookups 

- **Action Plan**  
  - Outline specific steps to address the areas for improvement.  
  - Add unit tests
  - Improve language normalization

### 5. Additional Notes
- Add any other relevant observations or feedback about your contribution.  
- The function is a good fit for my task “Highlight Job Listings Matching User Language Skills” because
  it is API-agnostic: just computes the flags
